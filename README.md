## 🚀 Who Am I?

I'm a data-driven problem solver with 3+ years of experience helping businesses work smarter — not harder.  
Whether it’s streamlining financial reporting for a Fortune 200 company or identifying $1M+ in revenue-saving opportunities for a SaaS firm, I bring together code, curiosity, and business context.

I recently graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a Master’s in Engineering Management, and I'm now on the lookout for my next adventure in analytics, operations, or strategy.

> TL;DR: I love transforming messy data into clean, actionable stories that drive decisions.
